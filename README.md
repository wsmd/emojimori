A little in-browser memory game (aka concentration) I built for fun. It has (for now) a 4 x 4 grid of cards that shuffle randomly on every run. The challenge was to buid this in less than 2.5 hours (between two shifts) :tada:.

The layout is built on top of Flexbox and CSS animations while the logic is written in Javascript. The game supports native Emojis using standardized Unicode characters.
